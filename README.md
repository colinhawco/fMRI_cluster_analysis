# fMRI_cluster_analysis

This is hopefully well organized. the different scripts include code for running the analysis and producing figures. 

As per HCP rules I cannot share the raw data, and to fully replicate it is necessasry to rebuild my initial task data matricies, which means extracting the HCP in a folder structure simialr to mine. 

If you have questions drop me a message or email me and I'll help if I can.
